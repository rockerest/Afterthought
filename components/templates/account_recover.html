			<p>You are receiving this email because you (or someone pretending to be you!) requested that your account be recovered.</p>
			<p>It's possible you forgot your password, or you forgot you even had an account.</p>
			<p>That's okay.</p>
			<p>To reset your password and log in, please <a href="http://afterthought.thomasrandolph.info/components/authentication/verify.php?code=<?=$hash;?>">click this link</a>.</p>
			<p>If you don't know what this is about, or you don't want the account, simply do nothing.</p>
			<p>The quick login link above is a one-time access pass to your account.  Please use it to reset your password and log in this time.</p>

			<p>Thanks!</p>
